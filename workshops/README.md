# Workshops
Welcome to the Blair Hack Club workshops directory! This is the codebase of all the content on the Blair Hack Club workshops site. Our directory consists of our recommended Hack Club workshops as well as all of our own workshops created by the Hack Clubbers and Blair.

Anyone can contribute a workshop. To create a workshop:
- Create a pull request to this repo with a new folder in the `workshops/` directory (this directory) called the name of your workshop. Make sure to follow the lowercase snake case format, like the other workshops. Put your workshop in a file named `README.md`.
  - `README.md` must be written in the Markdown syntax. We recommend [this cheatsheet](http://commonmark.org/help/) for getting started with Markdown.
  - At the top of the file, include the following metadata (author being your GitHub username):
    ```
    ---
    title: 'Colorful Grammar'
    thumbnail: 'https://image-address-of-the-workshop-thumbnail-image.com'
    description: 'Let your words color the screen'
    author: 'YourGithubUsername'
    date: '2021-5-17'
    ---
    ```
- Submit! Your workshop will be live on the site as soon as your pull request gets merged. We may suggest a few revisions before finalizing your workshop.

If you have any questions, join our [Discord](https://bhc.page.link/discord) and we'll be more than happy to give you a hand. :)
